<h2>	The Value of Money  </h2>

<p>
	


In the simplest of terms, money is a medium of exchange that people use to trade goods and services. Money, in all it’s different forms we call currencies has purchasing power - variations in purchasing power is what makes currencies different from each other. Now, these variations in purchasing power occur because people in different areas of the world have different demands for money. 

That’s how the true value of money is dependent on factors such as people’s demand for money and its purchasing power. However, these two interdependent factors can create a money cycle that’s ever expanding. To reign it in, we have another factor - time.We determine the true value of money by keeping in mind its purchasing power in real time. That is, we’d consider how much purchasing power $50 have now as compared to how much of it they had 20 years ago. Evidently, the purchasing power they hold now is less than that in 2000, making them less valuable, i.e. they can buy much less stuff. 

This phenomenon of money’s purchasing power continuously changing over time is called inflation.
In a general sense, when it’s growing slowly and steadily, it indicates economic growth. In more extreme case, it indicates fluctuations that are bad for a country’s economic health - mostly occurs after a crisis, industrial or natural disasters.

We can hence say that value of money is a concept made up of multiple factors, each in turn affected by various social, cultural and political factors - varying country by country.

				GMO (Genetically Modified) Food refers to food that’s produced by organisms whose DNA is modified using Genetic Engineering methods. It may sound like a food group limited to laboratories, around 90% of corn, soy and canola grown in North America is genetically-modified.

				On the brighter side, all GMO food that ends up in our grocery stores is FDA-approved - making them safe for consumption. One of the earliest examples of GMO foods in grocery stores was the Flavr Savr tomato, genetically-modified to stay firm, red and not rot for longer than natural tomatoes. Following the tomato were the Arctic Apple which resisted browning and the Innate Potato which resists rotting. 

				Even though the first impression that formed in your mind would be that genetically-modified inherently means bad - that’s not entirely true. Even though we wouldn’t call these foods entirely natural or organic, food biotechnology can indeed make foods genetically superior, often making them healthier and more nutritionally-dense. More than that, food production becomes more efficient when less food goes to waste due to rotting.

				With the rate of technological advancement we’re experiencing, 2100 would feel less like reality and more like a sci-fi movie. Although I wouldn’t say we’ll advance as far as flying cars being the norm, but I can definitely see the internet-of-things becoming a more widespread phenomenon - with more sophisticated internet-enabled gadgets playing an integral part in everyone’s lives.

				Along with that, I believe substantial medical advancements will take place - making medical procedures safer and more accessible for everyone. Moreover, I think both the volume and efficiency of food production will increase - which is more or less a necessity if we consider the rate at which the world population has been  growing for the last couple of decades. On that topic, population will cease to grow with as high a rate as more and more people are becoming averse to the idea of child-bearing, whether it be for reasons related to sustainability or something more personal. 

				We’d also be able to witness most manual jobs becoming obsolete - making way for robot workers. Jobs would instead centre around creativity and analytical thinking - processes that are difficult for machines and AI to replicate. All in all, the world in 2100 would be a sight to behold.
