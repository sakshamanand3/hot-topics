<h2>	The Value of Money  </h2>

<p>
	


In the simplest of terms, money is a medium of exchange that people use to trade goods and services. Money, in all it’s different forms we call currencies has purchasing power - variations in purchasing power is what makes currencies different from each other. Now, these variations in purchasing power occur because people in different areas of the world have different demands for money. 

That’s how the true value of money is dependent on factors such as people’s demand for money and its purchasing power. However, these two interdependent factors can create a money cycle that’s ever expanding. To reign it in, we have another factor - time.We determine the true value of money by keeping in mind its purchasing power in real time. That is, we’d consider how much purchasing power $50 have now as compared to how much of it they had 20 years ago. Evidently, the purchasing power they hold now is less than that in 2000, making them less valuable, i.e. they can buy much less stuff. 

This phenomenon of money’s purchasing power continuously changing over time is called inflation.
In a general sense, when it’s growing slowly and steadily, it indicates economic growth. In more extreme case, it indicates fluctuations that are bad for a country’s economic health - mostly occurs after a crisis, industrial or natural disasters.

We can hence say that value of money is a concept made up of multiple factors, each in turn affected by various social, cultural and political factors - varying country by country.
